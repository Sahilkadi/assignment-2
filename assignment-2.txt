you want and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like 
a table, heading, div, or span tag.

13.What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?
CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline 
CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an 
internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML

14.What is embedded style sheets?
An embedded style sheet is declared within the <head> element of an XHTML document. It applies to the 
whole document, rather than just one element. Each style declaration (or CSS rule) gets applied to 
everything in the document that matches that rule.

15.What are the external style sheets?
An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head 
section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an 
external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.

16.What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?
Reusable styles: An external style sheet can be reused across multiple pages and websites, saving time 
and making it easier to maintain a consistent look and feel. Improved performance: An external style 
sheet is only loaded once, even if it is used on multiple pages.
